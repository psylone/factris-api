# Install the pg driver:
#   gem install pg
# On macOS with Homebrew:
#   gem install pg -- --with-pg-config=/usr/local/bin/pg_config
# On macOS with MacPorts:
#   gem install pg -- --with-pg-config=/opt/local/lib/postgresql84/bin/pg_config

# gem 'pg'
#
# In fact we can leave default Rails DB config untouched,
# but in my opinion it's a convenient way to keep all
# configuration in `Settings` using `Config` gem.
